Implementation of a Variational Autoencoder to draw MNIST dataset characters using Tensorflow. This [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/teaching-a-variational-autoencoder-vae-to-draw-mnist-characters-978675c95776) from the **TowardsDataScience** community helped me to understand and build this awesome digit drawer.

## Contribution
This digit drawer works out, but it still lacks the expected accuracy for **reconstructing** the learned digits. Various optimization techniques will be added soon.

* Please create a **PR** to improve this work.
